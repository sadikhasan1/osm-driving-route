# OpenStreetMap Driving Distance and Route Highlight

This is a simple web application that uses OpenStreetMap, Leaflet, and Leaflet Routing Machine to calculate driving distances and display route highlights between two locations.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:sadikhasan1/osm-driving-route.git
   cd osm-driving-route
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the application in action.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. The map will be displayed, and you'll see two markers representing the start and end locations.

3. You can customize the start and end locations by modifying the latitude and longitude values in the script section.

4. The route between the start and end locations will be calculated and displayed on the map, with a customizable color for the route line.

## Customization

- To change the color of the route highlight, modify the `lineOptions` in the script section. You can change the `color`, `opacity`, and `weight` properties.

## Libraries Used

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/): An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- [Leaflet Routing Machine](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/): A routing plugin for Leaflet that provides support for various routing services.
